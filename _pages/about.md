Hi! I'm Xi, a Ph.D. student at Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, New York, United States. I'm advised by [Professor Hong Qin](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~qin/). I was previously an undergraduate student at Department of Computer Science And Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. 

Research
======

My research interests lie in the field of Machine Learning (ML), Computer Graphics (CG) and GPU algorithms. In my research projects, I'm applying neural techniques to the task of Physics-based modeling, which involves the creation and manipulation of 3D models with Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), as well as designing efficient and interpretable PDE solvers with ML techniques. I'm also working on Mamba, which is a DE-driven fountation model with various applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV). 

These research projects endow me with solid knowledge and rich experience in the design, profiling, and fine-tuning of high-performance GPU kernels, as well as expertise in ML frameworks (including customized PyTorch C++/CUDA extensions.) My research work are published in top-venue conferences including ICML and CVPR. 

Teaching
======

I’ve also worked as a Teaching Assistant for the Computer Graphics course offered at Stony Brook University, including an undergraduate version, [CSE 328 (Fundamentals of Computer Graphics)](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~cse328/index.html), and a graduate version, [CSE 528 (Computer Graphics)](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~qin/courses/graphics/graphics.html).

Misc
======

I speak three languages. I’m a native speaker of Chinese (Mandarin). I’m fluent in English (proficient for work and study purposes: TOEFL 106/120; GRE 324/340 + 3.5). I’m also proficient in Japanese (sufficient for basic work and study scenarios: JLPT N1 173/180, N2 169/180).
