Hi! I'm Xi, a Ph.D. student at Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, New York, United States. I'm supervised by [Professor Hong Qin](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~qin/). I was previously an undergraduate student at Department of Computer Science And Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. 

Research
======

My research interests lie in the field of Computer Graphics. In my research projects, I’m applying neural techniques to the task of Physics-based modeling, which involves the creation and manipulation of 3D models with Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). These tasks are heavily involved with Numerical Computation and Machine Learning. I’m also working on inverse modeling problems by developing differentiable neural PDE solvers.

These research projects endow me with solid knowledge in Numerical Analysis, rich experience in high-performance C++/CUDA programming and fine-tuning, and expertise in machine learning skills with Python/PyTorch (including customized PyTorch operators and C++/CUDA extensions.)

Teaching
======

I’ve also worked as a Teaching Assistant for the Computer Graphics course offered at Stony Brook University, including an undergraduate version, [CSE 328 (Fundamentals of Computer Graphics)](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~cse328/index.html), and a graduate version, [CSE 528 (Computer Graphics)](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~qin/courses/graphics/graphics.html).

Misc
======

I speak three languages. I’m a native speaker of Chinese (Mandarin). I’m fluent in English (proficient for work and study purposes: TOEFL 106/120; GRE 324/340 + 3.5). I’m also proficient in Japanese (sufficient for basic work and study scenarios: JLPT N1 173/180, N2 169/180).
