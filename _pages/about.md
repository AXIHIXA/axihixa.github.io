Hi! I'm Xi, a Ph.D. student at Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, New York, United States. I'm supervised by [Professor Hong Qin](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~qin/). I was previously an undergraduate student at Department of Computer Science And Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. 

Research
======

My research interests lie in the field of Computer Graphics. In my research projects, I'm applying neural techniques on the task of Physics-based modeling, which involves the creation and manipulation of 3D models with Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). These tasks are heavily involved with Numerical Computation and Machine Learning. I'm also working on inverse modeling problems by differentiable neural PDE solvers. 

These research projects endows me with expertise in solid knowledge in Numerical Analysis, rich experience in high-preformance C++/CUDA programming and fine-tuning, and machine learning skills with Python/PyTorch (including CUDA extensions.)

Teaching
======

I've also worked as Teaching Assistant for the Computer Graphics course offered at Stony Brook University, including an undergraduate version, [CSE 328 (Fundamentals of Computer Graphics)](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~xihan1/courses/cse328/ta_help_page.html), and a graduate version, [CSE 528 (Computer Graphics)](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~xihan1/courses/cse528/ta_help_page.html).
