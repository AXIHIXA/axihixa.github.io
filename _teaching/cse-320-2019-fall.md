This course introduces C programming and essential concepts of operating systems, compilers, concurrency, and performance analysis, focused around several cross-cutting examples, such as memory management, error handling, and threaded programming. In this course, operating systems concepts are considered from the point of view of the application programmer, and the focus is on APIs for interacting with an operating system. 

I worked as a Teaching Assistant for Fall 2019 semester. My duties include host office hours, grading programming assignments (automated grading with criterion unittest framework, download from Gitlab repos, and push the grading sheets back), and monitoring exams. This course is my first TA course and taught me a lot interacting with students, as well as developing Python scripts for automated routines and web applications.
