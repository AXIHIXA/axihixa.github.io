CSE 328 is an undergraduate course which covers the basic concepts, mathematical foundations, fundamental theories and algorithms, software techniques, hardware and system issues, and application examples of computer graphics. The main topics will center on modeling, rendering, interaction, and animation. I served as a Teaching Assistant for Spring 2025. 

Apart from regular work as a Teaching Assistant (hosting office hours, grading assignments and exam papers, and hosting in-class recitations of exam results), I'm also offering three tutorials on OpenGL programming with C++/Python each semester. These tutorials are much appreciated by students taking the course. 

I also helped the course instructor completely re-design (in Spring 2021) and maintain (in all succeeding semesters) the [course website](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~cse328/index.html). I also worked on refining the course policies with details, including submission policies, testing platforms, grading policies, etc. These efforts have made the course more formal than before. 

Furthermore, I'm offering program templates to students, and to offer students with comfortable and efficient office visits, I completed all programming assignments myself too (the templates are extracted by my own solutions). These templates are available at [StonyBrookCSE328Graphics](https://github.com/AXIHIXA/StonyBrookCSE328Graphics).
